# Overview

This repository contains the code ```inst_opt_bound```, to calculate horizontal flows at the Core-Mantle Boundary (CMB) that optimise the rate-of-change of a geomagnetic quantity (such as the dipole tilt and the inclination at a specific location at the Earth's surface). Based on the algorithm developed by Livermore et al., 2014 ( https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X13006547 )
