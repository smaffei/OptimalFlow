# Overview

This repository contains the code ```inst_opt_bound```, to calculate horizontal flows at the Core-Mantle Boundary (CMB) that optimise the rate-of-change of a geomagnetic quantity (such as the dipole tilt and the inclination at a specific location at the Earth's surface). Based on the algorithm developed by Livermore et al. (2014) and Maffei et al. (unpublished as of April 2021).

Also included in the repository is a jupyte Notebook (.ipynb file) to create a sample global map plotting the resulting optimal flow on top of the background magnetic field.

# inst_opt_bound

## Usage

### Compile the code

Compilation of the optimisation code ```inst_opt_bound.F90``` has the following requirements:
- a Fortran compiler like ```gfortran```
- having the ```fftw3``` library installed on your system


The repository contains two Makefiles ready to use:
- ```Makefile_optimisation_mac``` which uses ```gfortran``` version 8.2.0 and has been successfully tested on macOS High Sierra (10.13.6).  
  
  Usage: ```make -f Makefile_optimisation_mac```  
  
  Note that compilation with this version of gfortran causes warnings to be displaied concerning placement of commas after ```WRITE``` commands and is due to a change in standards in ```gfortran``` that occurred during the development of the code and have not been corrected. The option ```-ffree-line-length-0```
- ```Makefile_optimisation``` which uses the ```ifort``` compiler and has been designed for use on a remote cluster where the ```fftw3``` library could be loaded as a module.  
  
  Usage: ```make -f Makefile_optimisation_mac```  
  
Either option will create the ```inst_opt_bound``` executable in the same folder as the Makefile used (unless otherwise specified by modifying the Makefile)

### Running the code

#### Basic usage
```./inst_opt_bound```
