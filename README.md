# Overview <a name="overview"></a>

This repository contains the Fortran code ```inst_opt_bound```, to calculate horizontal flows at the Core-Mantle Boundary (CMB) that optimise the rate-of-change of a geomagnetic quantity (such as the dipole tilt and the inclination at a specific location at the Earth's surface). Based on the algorithm developed by Livermore et al. (2014) and Maffei et al. (unpublished as of April 2021).

Also included in the ```Python27``` folder is a jupyter Notebook (```plot_flow.ipynb```) to create a sample global map plotting the resulting optimal flow on top of the background magnetic field.

In the ```models/``` folder are included three background magnetic model files:
- ```CHAOS-6-x9_core_2019.0007.dat``` the CHAOS-6-x9 geomagnetic field model ( http://www.spacecenter.dk/files/magnetic-models/CHAOS-6/ ) for the beginning of 2019
- ```MODEL.dat``` a dipole field with weak horizontal components. These small components are needed to stabilise the calculation for optimal rate-of-change of VGP latitude and dipole tilt when ```LMAX_B_OBS=1``` (see below for details)
- ```axial_dipole.dat``` a purely axial dipole field

# Instantaneous optimal flow calculation with inst_opt_bound <a name="InstOptimalFlowCalculation"></a>

## Compiling the code <a name="CompileTheCode"></a>

Compilation of the optimisation code ```inst_opt_bound.F90``` has the following requirements:
- a Fortran compiler like ```gfortran```
- having the ```fftw3``` library installed on your system


The repository contains two Makefiles ready to use:
- ```Makefile``` which uses ```gfortran``` version 8.2.0 and has been successfully tested on macOS High Sierra (10.13.6).  
  
  Usage: ```make```  
  
  You will have to make sure that the ```FFLAGS``` and ```LDFLAGS``` in the ```Makefile``` point at the folders containing, respectively, ```fftw3.h``` and ```libfftw3.a```.
  
  Note that compilation with this version of gfortran causes warnings to be displaied concerning placement of commas after ```WRITE``` commands and is due to a change in standards in ```gfortran``` that occurred during the development of the code and have not been corrected. The option ```-ffree-line-length-0```
- ```Makefile_optimisation``` which uses the ```ifort``` compiler and has been designed for use on a remote cluster where the ```fftw3``` library could be loaded as a module.  
  
  Usage: ```make -f Makefile_linux```  
  
Either option will create the ```inst_opt_bound``` executable in the same folder as the Makefile used (unless otherwise specified by modifying the Makefile)

## Running the code <a name="RunningTheCode"></a>

```./inst_opt_bound < input_optimisation_inclination```  

The input file ```input_optimisation_inclination``` is provided in the repository and sets up the code to calculate the flows that optimise the rate-of-change of inclination at a location corresponding to the Sulmona basin, in Central Italy, with the background magnetic field provided by the 2019 realisation of the CHAOS 6 model (provided in the repository)

# Flow visualisation with plot_flow.ipynb <a name="FlowVisualisation"></a>

After the optimal flows have been calculated successfully (```.DAT``` files are present in the main directory), simply run the jupyter Notebook ```plot_flow.ipynb```.

This Notebook has been written in Jupyter Notebook 4.4.1, with Python 2.7.11 installed via Anaconda version 1.9.12 (```conda``` 4.8.3) and runs successfully on macOS High Sierra (10.13.6). Jupyter Notebook might require to downgrade the package ```tornado``` to version 4.5.3.

Other requirements:
- ```numpy``` version 1.15.4
- ```sys```
- ```matplotlib``` version 2.2.5
- ```Basemap``` version 1.3.0

The ```Basemap``` package is not maintained anymore and upgrade to Python 3 might require the use of ```cartopy``` instead.


# Details of the algorithm and structure of the code <a name="algorithm"></a>

The Fortran code implements the optimisation algorithm first presented in Livermore et al. (2014) and expanded in Maffei et al. (in prep) and details can be found therein.

The code finds the spherical harmonics coefficients **q** of the toroidal and poloidal horizontal components of the flow **u<sub>H</sub>** at the Core-Mantle Boundary that optimise the rate of change of a given quantity _A_ (selected via ```MINIM_FLAG```) that can be defined as a function of the Gauss coefficients and their time derivatives. The formula that is implemented is:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\textbf{q}_\text{opt}&space;=&space;\frac{1}{2\lambda}&space;\textbf{E}^{-1}&space;\textbf{G}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\textbf{q}_\text{opt}&space;=&space;\frac{1}{2\lambda}&space;\textbf{E}^{-1}&space;\textbf{G}" title="\textbf{q}_\text{opt} = \frac{1}{2\lambda} \textbf{E}^{-1} \textbf{G}" /></a>

where **G** is a vector relating the rate-of-change of _A_ to the flow coefficients **q** via

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\dot{A}=&space;\textbf{G}^T\textbf{q}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dot{A}=&space;\textbf{G}^T\textbf{q}" title="\dot{A}= \textbf{G}^T\textbf{q}" /></a>

and the elements of **G** are a function of the Gauss coefficients of the background magnetic field; **E** is a diagonal matrix with elements <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=E_k=l(l&plus;1)(2l&plus;1)^{-1}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?E_k=l(l&plus;1)(2l&plus;1)^{-1}" title="E_k=l(l+1)(2l+1)^{-1}" /></a> and <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\lambda" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda" title="\lambda" /></a> is a Lagrange multiplier that ensures that the rms of the optimal flow is ```TARGET_RMS```. 

The flow coefficients are saved in the output file ```OPTIMAL_FLOW.DAT``` and define the horizontal flow via the formula

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\begin{align*}&space;\textbf{u}_H&space;=&space;&\sum_{l=1}^{LMAX\_U}\sum_{m=0}^l&space;\Big\{&space;{_ct_l^m}&space;\nabla\times&space;{_cY_l^m}(\theta,\phi)\textbf{r}&space;&plus;&space;{_st_l^m}&space;\nabla\times&space;{_sY_l^m}(\theta,\phi)\textbf{r}&space;\Big\}&space;\\&space;&plus;&space;&&space;\sum_{l=1}^{LMAX\_U}\sum_{m=0}^l&space;\Big\{&space;{_cs_l^m}&space;\nabla_H[&space;{_cY_l^m}(\theta,\phi)r]&space;&plus;&space;{_ss_l^m}&space;\nabla_H[&space;{_sY_l^m}(\theta,\phi)r]\Big\},&space;\end{align*}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\begin{align*}&space;\textbf{u}_H&space;=&space;&\sum_{l=1}^{LMAX\_U}\sum_{m=0}^l&space;\Big\{&space;{_ct_l^m}&space;\nabla\times&space;{_cY_l^m}(\theta,\phi)\textbf{r}&space;&plus;&space;{_st_l^m}&space;\nabla\times&space;{_sY_l^m}(\theta,\phi)\textbf{r}&space;\Big\}&space;\\&space;&plus;&space;&&space;\sum_{l=1}^{LMAX\_U}\sum_{m=0}^l&space;\Big\{&space;{_cs_l^m}&space;\nabla_H[&space;{_cY_l^m}(\theta,\phi)r]&space;&plus;&space;{_ss_l^m}&space;\nabla_H[&space;{_sY_l^m}(\theta,\phi)r]\Big\},&space;\end{align*}" title="\begin{align*} \textbf{u}_H = &\sum_{l=1}^{LMAX\_U}\sum_{m=0}^l \Big\{ {_ct_l^m} \nabla\times {_cY_l^m}(\theta,\phi)\textbf{r} + {_st_l^m} \nabla\times {_sY_l^m}(\theta,\phi)\textbf{r} \Big\} \\ + & \sum_{l=1}^{LMAX\_U}\sum_{m=0}^l \Big\{ {_cs_l^m} \nabla_H[ {_cY_l^m}(\theta,\phi)r] + {_ss_l^m} \nabla_H[ {_sY_l^m}(\theta,\phi)r]\Big\}, \end{align*}" /></a>

where <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex={_ct_l^m},&space;{_st_l^m},&space;{_cs_l^m}&space;\text{&space;and&space;}&space;{_ss_l^m}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?{_ct_l^m},&space;{_st_l^m},&space;{_cs_l^m}&space;\text{&space;and&space;}&space;{_ss_l^m}" title="{_ct_l^m}, {_st_l^m}, {_cs_l^m} \text{ and } {_ss_l^m}" /></a>, for which **q** is a shorthand notation, are the toroidal (_t_) and poloidal (_s_) coefficients for the cosine and sine spherical harmonic component of degree _l_ and order _m_. See Livermore et al. (2014) and Maffei et al. (in prep) for more mathematical detail and explanation on the symbols. Furthermore, the jupyter Notebook ```plot_flow.ipynb``` converts flow and Gauss coefficients to flow and magnetic field in physical space for visualisation purposes.

The optimal rate-of-change of _A_ driven by the optimal flow calculated as above is stored in ```OPTIMISED_QUANTITY_DOT.DAT```.

The code in ```inst_opt_bound.F90``` prompts the user for the input parameter (see above) and passes them to ```optimisation_bound.F90```, where the calculation of the coefficients **q** actually takes place. 

The functions defined in ```subs.F90``` handle the spherical harmonics transforms (via ```fftw3``` and Legendre transforms) for the flow and magnetic field components (and their time derivatives). 

Also in ```subs.F90``` is defined 
- the precision of the calculation, via the ```LONG_REAL``` and the ```EXTRA_LONG_REAL``` variables. To increase the resolution of the final result, change the value of ```EXTRA_LONG_REAL```. ```LONG_REAL=8``` and ```EXTRA_LONG_REAL=8``` should suffice for most calculations, though we find that the VGP latitude (```MINIM_FLAG = 7```) requires ```EXTRA_LONG_REAL=16```
- GMT geographical grid resolution for ```*CENTRED.DAT``` output files, ```NTHETA_GRID_CONTOUR_GMT = 100, NPHI_GRID_CONTOUR_GMT = 200```
- the grid spacing for arrows in ```FLOW_VECTORS_CENTRED.DAT```, ```GMT_THETA = 30, GMT_PHI = 30```
- the number of random points in ```FLOW_VECTORS_RANDOM.DAT```, ```NUMBER_RANDOM_START_PTS = 1000```
- the CMB and Earth's surface radii: ```CMB_RADIUS = 3485.0E3_8, ES_RADIUS = 6371.0E3_8```
